# palindromes
A small script to test if a word is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

## Why?
Palindromes are cool.

But this is mostly an experiment on how to use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) together with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). This way we are able to utilize the latest features from [ES2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0) which are not yet available in Node.js.

At the time of writing I believe the only feature this example uses that is not available is  [Modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html). But those are just too cool to live without, right?

## How
Test using [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape):
```
$ npm run test
```
Develop using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon):
```
$ npm run dev
```
